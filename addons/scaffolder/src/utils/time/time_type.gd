class_name TimeType


# The different types of time that are tracked.
# 
# -   Fixed-interval/physics-based tracking vs clock and render-based tracking:
#     -   In general, use fixed-interval/physics-based tracking for most cases,
#         unless you know you need something else.
#         -   Fixed-interval tracking is deterministic, which means you should
#             see the same results each time you run the app.
#     -   "Clock" and "render"-based tracking should represent actual time more
#         accurately than fixed-interval/physics-based tracking, since the
#         latter under-counts if a frame actually takes longer than the
#         expected fixed-interval duration.
#         -   This is useful if you want to actual track and display real
#             elapsed time to the player.
# -   App time vs play time:
#     -   App time tracks total time elapsed while the app has been running.
#     -   Play time tracks elapsed **unpaused** time.
# -   Scaled vs un-scaled time:
#     -   Scaled time is modified by the combination of the `time_scale` and
#         `additional_debug_time_scale` properties.
#         -   The current scale is applied to each individual frame's delta and
#             this is added to a running total.
#         -   So this accounts for changes in time scale.
