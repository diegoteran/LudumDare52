class_name PriorityQueue
extends Reference
## Holds an arbitrary number of values sorted by a weight assigned to set
## values.
## 
## -   Structure is a balanced BST.
## -   In order to compare non-int values, the input is in the form of an array
##     of size 2:
##     -   0: Priority value in form of int or float.
##     -   1: Value to store.

# 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
